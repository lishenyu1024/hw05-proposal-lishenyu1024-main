## Project Objectives

Develop a Pet Tinder website that allows pet owners to create profiles for their pets, including adding photos and liking other pets' profiles. The website will also incorporate a Maps API, allowing local pet owners to list their pets for public activities such as group walks, thereby promoting social interaction between pets and their owners.

## User Stories

  - Explore pets in my area
  - Organize or join group walks

## User Interface Design

The user interface will be simple and engaging, focusing on ease of use. We will use Figma to design the interface, including:
