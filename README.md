## Project Objectives

Develop a Pet Tinder website that allows pet owners to create profiles for their pets and list their pets for public activities such as group walks, thereby promoting social interaction between pets and their owners.

## User Stories

### Unregistered User
- As an unregistered user, I can:
  - Register with the application by providing a username and password

### Registered User
- As a registered user, I can:
  - Log in with previously provided credentials
  - Create a profile for my pet and list it for public activities
  - Add photos
  - Find other pets nearby to socialize with
  - Join a listed public activity

## User Interface Design

The user interface will be simple and engaging, focusing on ease of use. We will use Figma to design the interface, including:

- A landing page with a clear call-to-action (e.g., "Join Now")
